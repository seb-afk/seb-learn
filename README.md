WORK IN PROGRESS

## Motivation 
The purpose of this project is to implement various machine learning models
using best software development practices for the purpose of improving my own
understanding on the subject.

Some of these I might have implemented previously as part of various university
assignments, but unfortunately they are scattered around in jupyter notebooks
in different places. I wanted to everything together in one place.

My inspiration for this repo are the
[mlxtend](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend) library and to a lesser extend the
[sk-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library. If some parts of my code
are drawn / inspired from someone else I will make it known/put the appropriate
references. If I miss a reference please do not hesitate to let me know.
